ETA: The crying in the comments is honestly fucking embarrassing. Its literally cringeworthy reading them,
 it makes everyone look like children....grow the hell up. I am one of the ones that is hard on Joe quite a bit due to his l
 acking reviews (or lack thereof) lately, but that is because I LOVE his reviews and he is amazing at what he does. He finally does a rev
 iew, despite Nintendo probably not allowing him to make money off of it and the comments are complete fucking cancerous shit. Instead of enjoying t
 he review, the comments are filled with people arguing over a fucking score. You know what's ironic? Most of the CHILDREN complaining haven't even played the game, hell, they 
 even admit it in their comments. I am so sick of it....I own ALL the consoles and they are ALL amazing. I am sick and tired of whiny children telling others that THEIR review isn't valid.
 Games are fucking subjective and just because YOU wouldn't give it a 9/10 doesn't mean it doesn't deserve it or most wouldn't. The majority of people think this game is fucking amazing, get the fuck ove
 r it. I am a Playstation girl myself, so I'm not a Nintendo fangirl (not that there is anything wrong with that) and I agree with Joe here, its a solid 9/10. I also would have docked a point for the weapon durabil
 ity system being so shit, not because weapons break, but because its poorly implemented. For those saying the games doesn't 
deserve this score because its mediocre (despite most of the morons saying that haven't not even played the game) it's HIS review, a review is an OPINION/subjective so he can fucking score it any way he wants.....
